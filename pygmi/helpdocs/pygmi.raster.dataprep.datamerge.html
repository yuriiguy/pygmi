		<h1>Dataset Mosaic</h1>
		<p>This will allow datasets to be mosaiced. The input is a directory which contains ONLY data to be mosaiced.</p> 
		<p>The user can merge files with different numbers of bands, and only bands with common names will be merged. If files being mosaiced have z values which are offset, the user can select to shift the bands to their respective median value prior to merge to minimise this.</p>
		<h2>General Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Batch directory - location of files to be mosaiced.</li>
			<li>Shapefile for boundary - This is an optional location for a shapefile to be used to cut the mosaic to a specific boundary.</li>
      <li>Nodata Value - Optional definition for the nodata/null value.</li>
			<li>Output Resolution - Optional definition for the mosaiced cell size.</li>
			<li>Shift bands to median value before mosaic. May allow for cleaner mosaic if datasets are offset - unchecked by default.</li>
			<li>Save each band separately in a mosaic directory - this is useful when the resultant mosaic is too large.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Mosaic Method</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Median - shift last file to median overlap value and copy over first file at overlap.</li>
			<li>First - copy first file over last file at overlap.</li>
			<li>Last - copy last file over first file at overlap.</li>
			<li>Min - copy pixel wise minimum at overlap.</li>
			<li>Max - copy pixel wise maximum at overlap.</li>
		</ul>
